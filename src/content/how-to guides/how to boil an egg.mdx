Careful timing is required to boil your egg to the perfect consistency. If you leave the egg in too long, you'll have an overcooked, green-tinged yoke. Too short and your egg may be underdone.

##### To boil an egg

1. Put eggs in a pot and cover by an inch with cold water.
1. Over medium-high heat, bring the water to a boil.
1. When the water boils, turn the water off, cover the pot, and set a timer for 10 minutes.
